1. About Quick and Dirty Feed Parser

What's Quick and Dirty Feed Parser for?
Quick and Dirty Feed Parser is a lightweight .NET library designed to give developers an agnostic way of parsing RSS 2.0 and Atom 1.0 XML syndication formats. QD Feed Parser parses both Atom and RSS feeds into business objects with common interfaces which expose the substance of the feeds - that way you can get to the business of syndicating content without worrying about what format it's in.
Quick and Dirty Feed Parser works with .NET 4.0, Silverlight 4, and Windows Phone 7.

Why should I use Quick and Dirty Feed Parser?
Because it's awesome. QD Feed Parser spares you the banality known as XML parsing. It has a straightforward contract with the developers who use this library:

Pass the URI of a valid RSS/Atom feed to any IFeedFactory object's .CreateFeed method. 
Receive a fully populated IFeed object in return, which has all of the same members regardless of whether or not it's an RSS or an Atom feed. 
Do anything which violates this contact, promptly receive an Exception in return.

That's it. You send the parser the URI of a valid RSS 2.0 / Atom 1.0 feed and get a simple, populated .NET object in return. No XPath, no LINQ-to-XML, no dicking around with XML namespaces, no XML whatsoever. It's easy.
